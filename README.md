pylletTown
==========

pylletTown is a [TMX](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/wiki/TMX-Map-Format) based demo of the video game [Pok√©mon Red/Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue) running in python 3
I created it as a working showcase for Richard Jones's pygame TMX library that I've recently ported from python 2.x to python 3. The library allows for easy implementation and customization of tile based maps like the ones contained in this demo.

Installiation of the [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/install.html) and any version of [python3](http://www.python.org/getit/) is required to run this demo
